# Fragments 

A `Fragment` represents a reusable portion of your app's UI. A fragment defines and manages its own layout, has its own lifecycle, and can handle its own input events. Fragments can't live on their own. They must be hosted by an activity or another fragment. The fragment’s view hierarchy becomes part of, or attaches to, the host’s view hierarchy.

## What will you see in the app?

When you press the first fragment button, the first fragment screen will appear, and when you press the second fragment button, the second fragment screen will appear.
With fragments, we can show the transition between pages on a single screen.
